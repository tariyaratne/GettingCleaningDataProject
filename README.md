### Data Dictionary
==========================
This file describes the data outpout from the tidydata.txt file.
Note: Only avearage measurments across repeated activities (per subject) for few important measurements are included in this file (these were described in the original features_info.txt file)
These measurements include, the mean and standard deviation of 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions for gravity, tBodyAcc, tBodyAccJerk, tBodyGyro, tBodyGyroJerk
